## Welcome! I'm Sp0k,
I am a second year Computer Science student at Dalhousie University (Halifax, Canada). I aspire to become a video
game programmer one day. I'm currently working on these projects: ShiftNotes, BC-Wallet, Bifold-Wallet.

I am also currently learning Ruby on Rails and React Native before attacking C# and C++.
